- Allow different canvas contexts to be used, rather than locking the developer
  into 2D. It's sort of there already -- you could certainly build something
  around WebGL with what's already there -- but we could avoid the getImageData
  call for performance reasons if we don't care about 2D at the point of
  filtering.

- There are a tonne more filters that could be implemented. I'd like to start
  working on some of them, at least. Something that uses HSV might be nice,
  since I went to the trouble of implementing it and all.

- Part of me does wonder if this could optionally leverage Processing.js
  somehow. I should look into that at some stage.

- Start testing with Opera, should they ever manage to get a browser build out
  with both <video> and <canvas> support.
